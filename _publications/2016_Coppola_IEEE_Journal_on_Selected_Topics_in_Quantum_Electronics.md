title: "Twofold Self-Assembling of Nanocrystals into Nanocomposite Polymer"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016_Coppola_IEEE_Journal_on_Selected_Topics_in_Quantum_Electronics
excerpt: 'In this paper, we introduce a single-step self-assembling process aimed at forming two-dimensional (2-D) array microstructures made from a nanocomposite polymer layer in which are dispersed CdSe-CdS nanocrystals. The novelty of the process reported here is that it operates simultaneously as a two-fold process where the liquid polymer matrix is self-shaped by electrohydrodynamic pressure as a 2-D array of microstructures, while at the same time, the nanocrystals are self-assembled by dielectrophoretic forces. The proposed approach could inspire future smart fabrication techniques for producing self-assembled lensed nanocomposite layers. In principle, the method is scalable down to diameter lens up to few micrometers.'
