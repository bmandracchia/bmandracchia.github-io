In this study, we introduce a light-field flow cytometer (LFC), an IFC system capable of high-content, single-shot, and multi-color acquisition of up to 5,750 cells per second with a near-diffraction-limited resolution of 400-600 nm in all three dimensions. The LFC system integrates optical, microfluidic, and computational strategies to facilitate the volumetric visualization of various 3D subcellular characteristics through convenient access to commonly used epi-fluorescence platforms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFC in assaying, analyzing, and enumerating intricate subcellular morphology, function, and heterogeneity using various phantoms and biological specimens.

However, the exploration of rapid biological dynamics still poses a significant challenge due to the limitations of current digital camera architectures and the inherent compromise between imaging speed and other capabilities. Here, we introduce sHAPR, a high-speed acquisition technique that leverages the operating principles of sCMOS cameras to capture fast cellular and subcellular processes. sHAPR harnesses custom fiber optics to convert microscopy images into one-dimensional recordings, enabling acquisition at the maximum camera readout rate, typically between 25 and 250 kHz. We have demonstrated the utility of sHAPR with a variety of phantom and dynamic systems, including high-throughput flow cytometry, cardiomyocyte contraction, and neuronal calcium waves, using a standard epi-fluorescence microscope. sHAPR is highly adaptable and can be integrated into existing microscopy systems without requiring extensive platform modifications. This method pushes the boundaries of current fluorescence imaging capabilities, opening up new avenues for investigating high-speed biological phenomena.","2024","2024-06-18 16:53:15","2024-06-18 16:53:15","","4598","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group UK London PMID: 38816394","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MIRO is a deterministic framework that models the acquisition process and uses pixelwise noise correction to improve image quality. Our study demonstrates that this approach yields a remarkable restoration of the fluorescence signal for a wide range of microscopy systems, regardless of the detector used (e.g., electron-multiplying charge-coupled device, scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or photomultiplier tube).

Optofluidic microscopes use fluids' properties as an additional degree of freedom for optical detection and microfluidics to perform simple and low-cost object manipulation. Even though several devices have been optimized for fluorescence-based imaging, these systems can rarely resolve sub-micron details, posing a limit to the structures that can be studied. An exception is represented by systems developed for particle detection, which are capable to quantify protein expression and analyze small molecules even at nanoscale resolution. However, in this case, high resolution requires a low emitter density and it cannot be used to visualize densely packed structures such as membranes and organelles. Hence, we have developed a system for sub-diffractionlimited optofluidic scanning microscopy (OSM) that uses the optofluidics paradigm to extract the inherent super-resolution information of a confocal system. OSM uses the optofluidic flow scanning scheme and a multifocal illumination pattern to obtain resolution doubling with minimal system complexity. In addition, it does not require any mechanical part for the scanning, so that it can be readily adapted to different levels of integration from commercial microscopes to on-chip configurations. This makes our system the most viable configuration for super-resolution optofluidics, being both suitable for continuous flow scanning and compatible with on-chip configurations through the adoption of integrated optics, like custom micro-lenses or Fresnel zone plates. Finally, we demonstrate how the same concept can be adapted to digital slide scanners for super-resolution whole slide imaging.","2022","2024-06-18 16:53:16","2024-06-18 16:53:16","","3","","","11967","","","","","","","","SPIE","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 16057422","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two techniques, in particular, have gained the attention of scientists: The first is “biospeckle”, an optical technique representing an innovative tool for applications in food quality, food safety, and nutraceuticals. With this technique, we can quickly evaluate and monitor the presence of bacteria (or their proliferation) in a solid or liquid biological matrix. In addition, the technique is helpful in quantifying and optimizing the correct storage time of the pro-biotics, if they are entrapped in matrices such as alginate and follow their survival rate in simulated gastro-intestinal conditions. A second technique with great chances is the “biofilm electrostatic test” (BET). BET undoubtedly represents a fast, simple, and highly reproducible tool suitable for admitting the evaluation of the in vitro bacterial capacity in order to adhere through an electrostatic interaction with a pyro-electrified carrier after only 2 h of incubation.

Any slight misalignment can provoke incorrect synthesis of the observables and, in turn, severe phase errors in the resulting high-resolution image. Here, we present a new processing pipeline that automatically removes such a priori unknown artifacts, thus making Fourier Ptychography miscalibration-tolerant. This result is achieved through a numerical Multi-Look approach that generates and combines multiple reconstructions of the same set of observables where phase artifacts are largely uncorrelated and, thus, automatically suppress each other.

However, for sCMOS sensors, the parallel charge-voltage conversion and different responsivity at each pixel induces extra readout and pattern noise compared to charge-coupled devices (CCD) and electron-multiplying CCD (EM-CCD) sensors. This can produce artifacts, deteriorate imaging capability, and hinder quantification of fluorescent signals, thereby compromising strategies to reduce photo-damage to live samples. Here, we propose a content-adaptive algorithm for the automatic correction of sCMOS-related noise (ACsN) for fluorescence microscopy. ACsN combines camera physics and layered sparse filtering to significantly reduce the most relevant noise sources in a sCMOS sensor while preserving the fine details of the signal. The method improves the camera performance, enabling fast, low-light and quantitative optical microscopy with video-rate denoising for a broad range of imaging conditions and modalities.","2020","2024-06-18 16:53:16","2024-06-18 16:53:16","","1–12","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","PMID: 31901080","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the use of probiotics in food and health has increased enormously. A sufficient concentration of probiotics in the intestine acts against pathologies such as obesity, diabetes, etc. However, if probiotics are not able to maintain their viability during their transit through the gastro-intestinal apparatus, they cannot act to enhance the immune system. Hence, protection and preservation of probiotics are essential to both food industry and in pharmaceutics. Microencapsulation is one of the most common methods of preservation, applicable to several biological matrices, including probiotics. Whenever food products or pharmaceutical formulations contain microencapsulated probiotics, it is important to quantify the effectiveness of micro-encapsulation as a microbial protection system over the time, e.g. during the shelf life of a functional product containing encapsulated probiotics, conserved in the supermarket, and during gastro-intestinal transit. Here we use bio-speckle decorrelation as a tool for the rapid assessment of microencapsulation effectiveness. Although speckles are often thought as a noise to get rid of, they represent a precious source of information, increasing the sensitivity of image sensors based on coherent illumination. Such information is exploitable to characterize bacterial dynamics in a fast and simple way suitable for applications in food science and industry.

In global healthcare and point-of-care diagnostics there is an increasing request of medical equipment with devices able to provide fast and reliable testing for clinical diagnosis. In developing countries that lack of adequate facilities, this need is even more urgent. Lab-on-a-Chip devices have undergone a great growth during the last decade, supported by optical imaging techniques more and more refined. Here we present recent progresses in developing imaging tools based on holographic microscopy that can be very useful when applied into bio-microfluidics. Digital Holography (DH) is label-free, non-invasive, potentially high-throughput and, above all, quantitative. We show the recent advancements of DH in transmission microscopy mode, when this is applied to microfluidics to yield 3D imaging capabilities. Holographic flow cytometry through quantitative phase imaging and in-flow tomography for the analysis and manipulation of micro-particles and cells will be shown [1-3]. Medical diagnostic applications based on DH will be also shown.

We propose tackling this problem with a holographic technique that combines quantitative phase imaging with a custom setup designed to form and manipulate bubbles. The results, gathered on a model aqueous polymeric solution, provide unparalleled insight into bubble dynamics through the combination of a full-field thickness estimation, three-dimensional imaging, and a fast acquisition time.

To date, however, applications have been largely limited by the properties of the imaging modality. It is therefore highly desirable for a method generally applicable for processing miniscopy images, enabling and extending the applications to diverse anatomical and functional traits, spanning various cell types in the brain and other organs. We report an image processing approach, termed BSSE, for background suppression and signal enhancement for miniscope image processing. The BSSE method provides a simple, automatic solution to the intrinsic challenges of overlapping signals, high background and artifacts in miniscopy images. We validated the method by imaging synthetic structures and various biological samples of brain, tumor, and kidney tissues.

This makes holography the most suitable tool for underwater imaging, where many of the species under investigation are very fragile and can be damaged. In particular, we built up an optofluidic platform based on DHM able to perform such analysis in microfluidic environment, i.e. in dynamic conditions and also in case of a turbid medium. In this work, we take advantage of this technique to identify, sort and reconstruct the morphology of different classes of microplastics (e.g. PVC, PET, PP, etc.) dispersed in water, which are among the major pollutants in the ocean, and to provide an effective assessment of their abundance. By adopting special algorithms for numerical processing of the acquired images, we try to separate the plastics from other materials, such as organic debris (shell fragments, animals parts, diatoms, etc.) and other items (metal paint coatings, tar, glass, etc.). © 2018 SPIE.","2018","2024-06-18 16:53:17","2024-06-18 16:53:17","","60","","","10834","","","","","","","","SPIE","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 1996756X","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the variety of printable inks is still limited to those with relatively low viscosities (typically <20 mPa s) due to nozzle clogging problems. Here, we show the possibility of printing ordered microdots of high viscous inks such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) by exploiting the spontaneous breakup of a thin fiber generated through nozzle-free pyro-electrospinning. The PLGA fiber is deposited onto a partially wetting surface, and the breakup is achieved simply by applying an appropriate thermal stimulation, which is able to induce polymer melting and hence a mechanism of surface area minimization due to the Plateau-Rayleigh instability. The results show that this technique is a good candidate for extending the printability at the microscale to high viscous inks, thus extending their applicability to additional applications, such as cell behavior under controlled morphological constraints.","2018","2024-06-18 16:53:17","2024-06-18 16:53:17","","2122–2129","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: American Chemical Society PMID: 29278322","","C:\Users\biagi\Zotero\storage\SSSM7HLC\Mecozzi et al._ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces_2018_Easy Printing of High Viscous Microdots by Spontaneous Breakup of Thin Fibers.pdf","","microdots; microprinting; polymers; pyro-electrospinning; thin liquids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this scope, an important goal is to design imaging schemes that can be used out of the laboratory. In this paper, we introduce and test a pocket holographic slide that allows digital holography microscopy to be performed without an interferometer setup. Instead, a commercial off-the-shelf plastic chip is engineered and functionalized with this aim. The microfluidic chip is endowed with micro-optics, that is, a diffraction grating and polymeric lenses, to build an interferometer directly on the chip, avoiding the need for a reference arm and external bulky optical components. Thanks to the single-beam scheme, the system is completely integrated and robust against vibrations, sharing the useful features of any common path interferometer. Hence, it becomes possible to bring holographic functionalities out of the lab, moving complexity from the external optical apparatus to the chip itself. Label-free imaging and quantitative phase contrast mapping of live samples are demonstrated, along with flexible refocusing capabilities. Thus, a liquid volume can be analyzed in one single shot with no need for mechanical scanning systems.","2017","2024-06-18 16:53:18","2024-06-18 16:53:18","","e17055","","9","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\biagi\Zotero\storage\R8FUZ5XC\Bianco et al._Light Science & Applications_2017_Endowing a plain fluidic chip with micro-optics a holographic microscope slide.pdf","","Digital holography; Diffraction gratings; Lab-on-a-Chip; Micro-optics; Optical devices; Polymer printing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Here we introduce a compact holographic microscope embedded onboard a Lab-on-A-Chip (LoC) platform. A wavefront division interferometer is realized by writing a polymer grating onto the channel to extract a reference wave from the object wave impinging the LoC. A portion of the beam reaches the samples flowing along the channel path, carrying their information content to the recording device, while one of the diffraction orders from the grating acts as an off-Axis reference wave. Polymeric micro-lenses are delivered forward the chip by Pyro-ElectroHydroDynamic (Pyro-EHD) inkjet printing techniques. Thus, all the required optical components are embedded onboard a pocket device, and fast, non-iterative, reconstruction algorithms can be used. We use our device in combination with a novel high-Throughput technique, named Space-Time Digital Holography (STDH). STDH exploits the samples motion inside microfluidic channels to obtain a synthetic hologram, mapped in a hybrid space-Time domain, and with intrinsic useful features. Indeed, a single Linear Sensor Array (LSA) is sufficient to build up a synthetic representation of the entire experiment (i.e.The STDH) with unlimited Field of View (FoV) along the scanning direction, independently from the magnification factor. The throughput of the imaging system is dramatically increased as STDH provides unlimited FoV, refocusable imaging of samples inside the liquid volume with no need for hologram stitching. To test our embedded STDH microscopy module, we counted, imaged and tracked in 3D with high-Throughput red blood cells moving inside the channel volume under non ideal flow conditions.","2017","2024-06-18 16:53:19","2024-06-18 16:53:19","","103330R","","","10333","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 1996756X","","","","Digital Holography; Lab-on-A-chip; Microfluidics.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Speckle decorrelation is induced by the self-propelling movement of these organisms when they interact with coherent light. Hence, their presence can be detected using a simple setup in a condition in which the single element cannot be imaged, but the properties of the ensemble can be exploited. Thanks to the small magnification factor we set, our system can inspect a large Field-of-View (FoV).

This is a significant global problem. The most common symptoms of cataracts are glared and blurred vision. Usually, people with cataract have trouble seeing and reading at distance or in low light and also their color perception is altered. Furthermore, cataract is a sneaky disease as it is usually a very slow but progressive process, which creates adaptation so that patients find it difficult to recognize. All this can be very difficult to explain, so we built and tested an optical device to help doctors giving comprehensive answers to the patients""? symptoms. This device allows visualizing how cataract impairs vision mimicking the optical degradation of the crystalline related cataracts. This can be a valuable optical tool for medical education as well as to provide a method to illustrate the patients how cataract progression process will affect their vision.","2016","2024-06-18 16:53:20","2024-06-18 16:53:20","","96931V","","","9693","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 16057422","","","","[Ophthalmology; Optical Devices; Vision]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to obtain quantitative data of thin film thickness, usually scanning techniques have to be employed. Thanks to the simultaneous detection of amplitude and phase, we show that HoloSPRi provides a versatile imaging tool for high-throughput SPR detection, which yields, moreover, the possibility of non-scanning quantitative measurements of thin film thickness.","2016","2024-06-18 16:53:20","2024-06-18 16:53:20","","97182W","","","9718","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 16057422","","","","[Holography; Surface Plasmon Imaging; Thin films]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novelty of the process reported here is that it operates simultaneously as a two-fold process where the liquid polymer matrix is self-shaped by electrohydrodynamic pressure as a 2-D array of microstructures, while at the same time, the nanocrystals are self-assembled by dielectrophoretic forces. The proposed approach could inspire future smart fabrication techniques for producing self-assembled lensed nanocomposite layers.

SPRi is a widely spread tool for label-free detection of changes in refractive index and concentration, as well as mapping of thin films. Currently, most of the SPR sensors rely on the detection of amplitude or phase changes of light. Despite the high sensitivities achieved so far, each technique alone has a limited detection range with optimal sensitivity. Here we use a high numerical aperture objective that avoids all the limitations due to the use of a prism-based configuration, yielding highly magnified and distortion-free images. Holographic reconstructions of SPR images and real-time kinetic measurements are presented to show the capability of HoloSPR to provide a versatile imaging method for high-throughput SPR detection complementary to conventional SPR techniques.","2015","2024-06-18 16:53:21","2024-06-18 16:53:21","","4124–4128","","8","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments and characterizations have been carried out at different operating voltages and for voltage dependent emission color also combining the processability of organic materials with efficient luminescence displayed by inorganic nanocrystals (NCs). In fact, the experimental perspective to disperse emitting colloidal NCs into polymers has allowed to further engineer hybrid organic-inorganic materials introducing innovative functionalities as for instance photoluminescence conversion capabilities. This has proved of great interest for novel applications such as the fabrication of photonic crystals and, notably, of innovative solar cells showing enhanced efficiency.
