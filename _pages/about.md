## About Me
---

Hello! I am Biagio Mandracchia, a Ram√≥n y Cajal Research Fellow at the University of Valladolid. My primary research interest lies in the field of fluorescence microscopy and image restoration. Over the years, I have dedicated my efforts to developing innovative techniques aimed at enhancing the clarity and quality of microscopic images. These advancements are crucial for various scientific fields, enabling researchers to observe and analyze biological processes with greater precision.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:

- **Fluorescence Microscopy**: Exploring the fundamentals and applications of fluorescence microscopy to provide deeper insights into cellular and molecular structures.
- **Image Restoration**: Developing advanced algorithms and methods for restoring and enhancing microscopic images, making them clearer and more accurate for scientific analysis.
- **Optical Imaging Techniques**: Investigating new optical imaging methods to push the boundaries of what can be visualized and quantified at the microscopic level.

## Current Projects

- **Multiscale Image Restoration through Optimally-Sparse Representation (MIRO)**: This project focuses on creating a system that significantly improves the clarity of fluorescence microscopy images by addressing the limitations of current imaging detectors. The MIRO system utilizes optimally-sparse representation techniques to enhance image resolution and quality.
  
- **Quantitative Phase Imaging**: Working on novel microscopy techniques to achieve quantitative phase imaging in total internal reflection. This research aims to provide more detailed and accurate visualizations of cellular interfaces and dynamics.
  
- **Holographic Microscopy**: Developing methods for label-free quantification of cellular processes through holographic microscopy, which offers new ways to study the effects of various treatments on cells without the need for fluorescent labels.
